# Personal Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website built using **HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript**.  
I created this project to showcase my frontend skills, design sense, and understanding of how single-page applications work without using any frameworks.

The focus of this project is **clean UI, simple architecture, and real functionality**.
